### What is a Skin Disorder?

**A skin condition or skin disorder, also known as cutaneous condition, is any medical condition that affects the integumentary system‚Äîthe organ system that encloses the body and includes skin, nails, and related muscle and glands.**

**The major function of this system is as a barrier against the external environment.**

**The skin weighs an average of 4 kg (8.8 lb), covers an area of 2 m2 (22 sq ft), and is made of three distinct layers:**
1. The epidermis
 
2.  dermis
  
3. subcutaneous tissue.

### Class : representing six type of skin disorder

#### 1.  Psoriais 

* Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes a rash with itchy, scaly patches, most commonly on the knees, elbows, trunk and scalp.
* Psoriasis is a common, long-term (chronic) disease with no cure. It can be painful, interfere with sleep and make it hard to concentrate. 
* The condition tends to go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a while.
* Psoriasis is thought to be an immune system problem.
* The most common symptom is a rash on the skin, but sometimes the rash involves the nails or joints.


#### 2. Seboreic Dermatitis

* Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin disease that causes an itchy rash with flaky scales.
* It causes redness on light skin and light patches on darker skin.
* It‚Äôs also called dandruff, cradle cap, seborrhea, seborrheic eczema, and seborrheic psoriasis.
* It might look similar to psoriasis, eczema, or an allergic reaction.
* It usually happens on your scalp, but you can get it anywhere on your body.


#### 3. Lichen Planus

* Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is a condition that can cause swelling and irritation in the skin, hair, nails and mucous     membranes. 
* On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, itchy, flat bumps that develop over several weeks.
* Lichen planus is not a dangerous disease, and it usually goes away on its own.


#### 4. Pityeiasis Rosea

* Pityriasis rosea is a rash that usually begins as a large circular or oval spot on your chest, abdomen or back. Called a  herald patch, this spot can be up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) across.
* In most cases, pityriasis rosea is harmless and doesn't return after it goes away.
* If your case lasts longer than 3 months, check in with your doctor. You may have another condition or be reacting to a  medication


#### 5.  Cronic Dermatitis

* Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a condition that makes your skin red and itchy. 
* It's common in children but can occur at any age. Atopic dermatitis is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare periodically. 
* It may be accompanied by asthma or hay fever. No cure has been found for atopic dermatitis.

#### 6. Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris

*  Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is the name given to a group of rare skin disorders that present with reddish-orange coloured scaling patches with well-defined borders. 
* They may cover the entire body or just parts of the body such as the elbows and knees, palms and soles.
* The classic forms usually go away in 3 to 5 years with or without treatment. 
* This usually occur during early childhood or at the  age of 50-70 yrs.


### a.) Clinical Attributes:

### 1. erythema:

* Erythema is redness of the skin caused by injury or another inflammation-causing condition. Often presenting as a rash, erythema can be caused by environmental factors, infection, or overexposure to the sun (ie, sunburn).
* Rash severity ranges from mild to life threatening.
* Erythema multiforme (EM) is the most common type of erythema.
* There are two types of EM, minor and major.
    * Erythema multiforme minor (EM minor) typically occurs on the peripheral parts of the body,
    * EM major causes extensive, blistering sores on the lips and in the mouth. They can also appear on the eyes and genitals.
* Erythema multiforme usually occurs in adults 20 to 40 years of age, although it can occur in patients of all ages 



### 2. scaling:
* Scaling skin is the loss of the outer layer of the epidermis in large, scale-like flakes. The skin appears dry and cracked, though skin dryness isn't always to blame. Scaling skin is also called: desquamation. dropping of scales.


### 3. definite_borders:
* benign mole borders that tend to be smooth and even(regular), early melanoma borders possess uneven (irregular) borders.

### 4. Itching:
* Pruritus simply means itching. It can be associated with a number of disorders, including dry skin, skin disease.

### 4.1. koebner_phenomenon:
* is the appearance of new skin lesions on previously unaffected skin secondary to trauma.


### 5. polygonal_papules:
* Papules and polygonal plaques are shiny, flat-topped and firm on palpation. The plaques are crossed by fine white lines called Wickham striae. Hypertrophic lichen planus can be scaly. Atrophic lichen planus is a rare annular variant with an atrophic centre.

### 6. follicular_papules:
* Follicular contact dermatitis is usually characterized by individual papules that include a central hair follicle. 
* A follicular papule occurs when the inflammatory infiltrate accumulates within the epidermis of the follicle or in the perifollicular dermis. B. A nonfollicular papule is located within the skin, but is not associated with a hair follicle.


### 7.  oral_mucosal_involvement:
*  Oral involvement generally consists of mucosal ulceration associated with lesions of the underlying bone.


### 8. knee_and_elbow_involvement:
* Extensor surfaces are skin surfaces on the outside of a joint that are common regions for lesions or other skin changes in certain skin disorders.

For example, the front of the knee and the back of the elbow or forearm are extensor surfaces where inflamed skin and scaly patches of psoriasis may develop.


### 9. scalp_involvement:
* Scalp involvement in pemphigus is associated with a higher disease severity, longer time required to achieve complete clinical and serological remission and may indicate the need for a more aggressive therapeutical approach.

### b.) Histopathological Attributes:

### 10. melanin_incontinence: 
* Melanin incontinence (pigmentary incontinence) is the presence of melanin in the superficial dermis, due to the loss of melanin from damaged cells of the basal layer.

 ### 11. eosinophils_in_the_infiltrate:
* Pulmonary eosinophilia (PE) is defined as infiltration of eosinophils into the lung compartments constituting airways, interstitium, and alveoli. Various infections, drugs, parasites, autoimmune processes, malignancies and obstructive lung diseases have been associated with increased eosinophils in the lungs.


### 12. fibrosis_of_the_papillary_dermis:
* Papillary dermal fibrosis with vertical streaking of collagen bundles is characteristic. A characteristic finding of lichen simplex chronicus that is noted on electron microscopy is frequent collagen fibers attached to and just above the lamina basalis. Increased numbers of blood vessels can be encountered.

### 13. exocytosis:
* Exocytosis is the last step of the secretory pathway and it involves the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane, a process that, in fungi, ensures the delivery of cell wall-synthesizing enzymes, membrane proteins, and lipids in areas of active growth.


### 14. acanthosis:
* Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition that causes a dark discoloration in body folds and creases. It typically affects the armpits, groin and neck.

  ### 15.  hyperkeratosis:
*  A condition marked by thickening of the outer layer of the skin, which is made of keratin (a tough, protective protein). It can result from normal use (corns, calluses), chronic inflammation (eczema), or genetic disorders (X-linked ichthyosis, ichthyosis vulgaris).


### 16. parakeratosis:
* Parakeratosis is defined as the presence of nucleated keratinocytes in the stratum corneum, and is thought to be due to accelerated keratinocytic turnover. Parakeratosis may occur in both benign skin diseases (such as various dermatitides) and malignant neoplasms (such as squamous cell carcinoma).

### 17. clubbing_of_the_rete_ridges:
* This is the microscopic appearance of lentigo senilis, commonly known as an age or "liver" spot. The rete ridges are elongated and appear club-shaped or tortuous. Melanocytes are increased in the basal layer and melanophages appear in the upper dermis.

 ### 18. elongation_of_the_rete_ridges: 
* Mechanical stretching stimulates growth of the basal layer and rete ridges in the epidermis.

  ### 19. thinning_of_the_suprapapillary_epidermis:
* This was defined as a thinning of the granular layer at the tips of the papillae. The elongation of the rete pegs was also considered in this factor. It was graded on a visual analogue scale as 0 to 3 (nil to marked).

  ### 20. spongiform_pustule:
* An epidermal pustule formed by infiltration of neutrophils into necrotic epidermis in pustular psoriasis.

  ### 21. munro_microabcess:
* Munro's microabscess is an abscess (collection of neutrophils) in the stratum corneum of the epidermis due to the infiltration of neutrophils from papillary dermis into the epidermal stratum corneum.

### 22. focal_hypergranulosis:
* Hypergranulosis is an increased thickness of the stratum granulosum. It is seen in skin diseases with epidermal hyperplasia and orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis.


### 23. disappearance_of_the_granular_layer:
* H&E staining revealed slight acanthosis and multiple parakeratotic column with disappearance of the granular layer.
* Disapperence of stratum granulosum or granular layer that is a thin layer of cells in the epidermis lying above the stratum     spinosum and below the stratum corneum (stratum lucidum on the soles and palms).


### 24. damage _ of _ bassal _ layer
* The basal layer is the innermost layer of the epidermis, and contains small round cells called basal cells.


### 25. spongiosis
* Spongiotic dermatitis refers to dermatitis that involves fluid buildup in your skin.This process is known as spongiosis


### 26. saw _ tooth_ appearance _ of _ retes
* The meaning of SAW-TOOTHED is having teeth like those of a saw
  
* RETES---a network of intersecting blood vessels or intersecting nerves or intersecting lymph vessels.



### 27. perifollicular _ hyperkeratosis
Perifollicular hyperkeratosis, follicular hemorrhage, and corkscrew hairs are well-known cutaneous manifestations of ascorbic acid deficiency, along with xerosis, ecchymosis, edema, poor wound healing, and gingival hemorrhage.



### 28. follicular hyperkeratosis:
* Also known as inverted follicular hyperkeratosis, this condition presents as a single bump, often on the face, of middle-aged or older adults. 
* These growths are benign (noncancerous), but they often look like cancerous lesions.


### 29. band like infiltrate:
* An infiltrate of lymphocytes affects and obscures the basal epidermis, classically with a band like pattern.
* Sometimes the infiltrate is patchy. 
* There is associated basal cell degeneration. 
* Typical of eczema, the epidermis shows patchy spongiosis, nearly always with associated exocytosis of lymphocytes.
